This code performs imaging analysis of SuperDARN observations as described in "Bristow, W. A. (2019). Application of RADAR imaging analysis to SuperDARN observations. Radio Science, 54, 692â€“703. https://doi.org/10.1029/2019RS006851".

It requires the Intel oneAPI compiler, which can be obtained free of charge from Intel. It also requires the SuperDARN Radar Software Toolkit (https://github.com/SuperDARN/rst)

The makefile inlcuded in the archive should generate an executable that will be placed in the directory "~/bin". Edit the makefile if you would like it placed somewhere else.
